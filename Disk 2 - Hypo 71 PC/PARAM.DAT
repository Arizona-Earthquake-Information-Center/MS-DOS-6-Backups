line 1: ro,  lat/lon filter,  depth factor,   beta square
line 2: maximum bound for depth
line 3: 0=enter data from keyboard ( P ans S arrival times )
        1=enter data from file autodata.dat ( bach process )

Note:
     1) ro is the ratio between Vp and Vs.  ( 1.732 is the default )      

     2) Lat/lon filter. Normally the program converges when the change 
in latitude and longitude between two consecutives iterations is less or 
equal to Lat/lon filter. The default value is .009 degress. 
     
     3) depth factor same as 2) but for the depth.  The default value is 
.2 Km. 
     
     4) Beta square. See text for a complete explanation about the 
factor beta.
     
     5) Maximum bound for depth. To compute the depth of an event, the 
program has to know which are the physical limits where the source can 
be located. The minimum bound is zero Km ( The surface ) and the maximum 
bound has a default value of 200 Km. If you suspect that the depth of 
the event is deeper than 200 Km, just change this number.
