This document describes the datafiles  used  by  the  program  chypo.exe 
which is the compiled version of the original program BASIC-HYPO. 

Files used by chypo.exe: 

1)  param.dat:  This  file  contains  some  parameters which are used to 
initialize the program chypo.exe. Type the file for a description of the 
parameters. 

2) station.dat:  This file contains the number of seismological stations 
defined  as  well  as  their  Latitudes,  Longitudes,  P  corrections in 
seconds,  and S corrections in seconds.  Type the file to see the format 
used. 

3)  crustal.dat:  This  file  contains  the  number of velocities of the 
crustal model as well as the values  for  velocities  in  Km/s  and  the 
thickness of each layer in Km. 

4)  autodata.dat:  This file is optional.  It contains the data of the P 
and S arrival times as well as their weights.  If used,  data  will  not 
need to be entered from the keyboard. 

To  modify  the  above  files,  it  is  necessary  to  use  an Editor or 
Wordprocessor.  Each of these files contains information of  the  format 
used and the meaning of the different parameters. 

Note:  The  program  chypo.bas  is  the  basic  version  of  the program 
chypo.exe. 

The  compiled  version  chypo.exe  requires  an  8087  math  coprocessor 
installed in the computer. 

The  compiled  version  contains some machine language subroutines which 
have been implemented to take advantage of the special  capabilities  of 
the  8087 mathcoprocessor.  Although enough care has been taken to write 
and debug those routines  we  can  not  be  totally  sure  that  for  an 
especific case the program will not crash.  If this is the case,  please 
contact us so we can solve the problem.
